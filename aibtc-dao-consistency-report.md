# AIBTC DAO Platform Consistency Analysis

## 1. Error Code Definitions

### Inconsistency:
- Some contracts use `ERR_` prefix (most common)
- Some use full words like `INPUT_ERROR` (in `aibtc-onchain-messaging.clar`)
- Some use shorter forms like `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` vs `ERR_NOT_DAO_OR_EXTENSION`

### Recommendation:
Standardize all error codes with the `ERR_` prefix followed by a descriptive name in uppercase with underscores.

## 2. Print Event Notifications

### Inconsistency:
- Most contracts use a structured format with `notification` and `payload` fields
- The payload structure varies between contracts
- Some print events include more fields than others for similar actions

### Recommendation:
Standardize the print event structure across all contracts:
```
(print {
  notification: "[action-name]",
  payload: {
    // Consistent set of fields based on action type
  }
})
```

## 3. Function Naming Conventions

### Inconsistency:
- Some functions use hyphenated names (`set-payment-address`)
- Similar functions have different names across contracts (e.g., `toggle-resource` vs `allow-asset`)
- Some functions have inconsistent verb usage (e.g., `get-` vs direct noun)

### Recommendation:
Standardize function naming with consistent verbs:
- Use `get-` prefix for all read-only functions
- Use `set-` prefix for state-changing functions that update a single value
- Use consistent action verbs (`add-`, `remove-`, `toggle-`, etc.)

## 4. Variable Naming

### Inconsistency:
- Some variables use camelCase (`lastWithdrawalBlock`)
- Others use kebab-case in function parameters
- Inconsistent abbreviations (e.g., `pmt` vs `payment`)

### Recommendation:
Standardize on kebab-case for all function parameters and consistent abbreviations throughout.

## 5. Constants Naming

### Inconsistency:
- Some constants use `CFG_` prefix (`CFG_PAYMENT_TOKEN`)
- Others use descriptive names without prefixes (`VOTING_DELAY`)
- Some use `SELF` while others use `TREASURY` for contract principal

### Recommendation:
Standardize constant naming:
- Use all uppercase with underscores
- Use consistent prefixes for similar types of constants
- Standardize on `SELF` for the contract principal reference

## 6. Data Structure Consistency

### Inconsistency:
- Different naming conventions for similar data structures across contracts
- Inconsistent field names in similar data structures
- Varying approaches to optional fields

### Recommendation:
Create consistent data structure templates for common concepts (proposals, resources, etc.) and use them across all contracts.

## 7. Specific Inconsistencies Found

### Payment Processor Contracts
- Three nearly identical implementations (`aibtc-payment-processor-dao.clar`, `aibtc-payment-processor-stx.clar`, `aibtc-payment-processor-sbtc.clar`) with minor differences
- Inconsistent handling of payment methods

### Timed Vault Contracts
- Similar inconsistencies between `aibtc-timed-vault-dao.clar`, `aibtc-timed-vault-stx.clar`, and `aibtc-timed-vault-sbtc.clar`
- Different default values for similar concepts

### Proposal Contracts
- Inconsistent approach between `aibtc-action-proposals-v2.clar` and `aibtc-core-proposals-v2.clar`
- Different voting parameter names and structures

### Treasury Contract
- Inconsistent approach to asset management compared to other resource management

## 8. Documentation Style

### Inconsistency:
- Some contracts have detailed headers with version, title, summary
- Others have minimal or no documentation
- Inconsistent inline commenting style

### Recommendation:
Standardize documentation with:
- Consistent header format for all contracts
- Standard sections for traits, constants, data vars, etc.
- Consistent inline commenting style

## 9. Error Handling Patterns

### Inconsistency:
- Some functions use `try!` for authorization checks
- Others use `asserts!` directly
- Inconsistent error propagation

### Recommendation:
Standardize error handling patterns:
- Use `try!` consistently for authorization and external calls
- Use `asserts!` for validation checks
- Consistent approach to error propagation

## 10. Authorization Checks

### Inconsistency:
- Some contracts check `is-dao-or-extension` at the beginning
- Others perform checks later in the function
- Inconsistent implementation of the check itself

### Recommendation:
Standardize authorization checks:
- Always perform them at the beginning of functions
- Use consistent implementation across all contracts
